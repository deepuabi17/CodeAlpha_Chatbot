# CodeAlpha_Chatbot
Creating a basic chatbot is a great way to get started with programming and understanding how artificial intelligence can interact with users.
# Basic Concepts of a Chatbot:
Input Processing:
The chatbot receives and processes user input. This can be text input through a console, web interface, or messaging platform.
Response Generation:
Based on the processed input, the chatbot generates an appropriate response. This can be done using predefined rules or more advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
Output Delivery:
The chatbot sends the generated response back to the user.
